# **NYC Trip Fare Analysis**

## **Introduction**
This project is part of the *Foundations of Computer Science* course in the **Masterâ€™s degree in Data Science**, under the supervision of **Professor Gianluca della Vedova**. The goal is to analyze taxi trips in **New York City** using data from the [NYC Trip Fare dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/diishasiing/revenue-for-cab-drivers). The analysis involves data cleaning, feature engineering, and extracting insights based on trip details, fare amounts, and passenger behaviors.

## **Repository Structure**
The repository is organized as follows:

- **conf/**: Contains `conf.py`, a configuration file that sets up environment paths for this GitHub repository.
- **data/**: Stores the dataset downloaded from the Kaggle link provided above, specifically containing `data.csv`.
- **notebooks/**: Includes the Jupyter Notebook `foc-project-notebook.ipynb` that contains the development and implementation of the project code.


## **Objectives**
The analysis focuses on the following tasks:


1. Extract all trips with `trip_distance` larger than 50
2. Extract all trips where `payment_type` is missing
3. For each (`PULocationID`, `DOLocationID`) pair, determine the number of trips
4. Save all rows with missing `VendorID`, `passenger_count`, `store_and_fwd_flag`, `payment_type` in a new dataframe called `bad`, and remove those rows from the original dataframe.
5. Add a duration column storing how long each trip has taken (use `tpep_pickup_datetime`, `tpep_dropoff_datetime`)
6. For each pickup location, determine how many trips have started there.
7. Cluster the pickup time of the day into 30-minute intervals (e.g. from 02:00 to 02:30)
8. For each interval, determine the average number of passengers and the average fare amount.
9. For each payment type and each interval, determine the average fare amount
10. For each payment type, determine the interval when the average fare amount is maximum
11. For each payment type, determine the interval when the overall ratio between the tip and the fare amounts is maximum
12. Find the location with the highest average fare amount
13. Build a new dataframe (called `common`) where, for each pickup location we keep all trips to the 5 most common destinations (i.e. each pickup location can have different common destinations).
14. On the `common` dataframe, for each payment type and each interval, determine the average fare amount
15. Compute the difference of the average fare amount computed in the previous point with those computed at point 9.
16. Compute the ratio between the differences computed in the previous point and those computed in point 9. Note: you have to compute a ratio for each pair (payment type, interval).
17. Build chains of trips. Two trips are consecutive in a chain if (a) they have the same VendorID, (b) the pickup location of the second trip is also the dropoff location of the first trip, (c) the pickup time of the second trip is after the dropoff time of the first trip, and (d) the pickup time of the second trip is at most 2 minutes later than the dropoff time of the first trip.
**Hint**: Add a column `chain` to the dataset. A chain can have more than two trips.
